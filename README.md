# Reinforcement Learning Grid World

This project implements a grid-based reinforcement learning environment with Q-learning. The grid world is designed to train an agent to collect treasures while avoiding walls. The environment uses a graphical interface to visualize the agent's progress and rewards.

---

## Features

- **10x10 Grid World:** The environment consists of a 10x10 grid with cells containing treasures and walls.
- **Q-Learning Agent:** The agent learns using Q-learning with configurable learning rate (`beta`) and discount factor (`alpha`).
- **Treasure Collection:** The agent earns rewards for collecting treasures  (+10) and incurs penalties for movement (-1).
- **Walls and Obstacles:** Movement is restricted by walls defined at before training.
- **Visualization:** A graphical display shows the agent's actions and treasures collected.
- **Performance Tracking:** Rewards per step are plotted at the end of training cycle using `matplotlib` to visualize training progress.

## Installation

To use this project you need to install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame matplotlib
   ```

### Controls and Parameters

- **Environment Parameters:**
  - `BOARD_ROWS` and `BOARD_COLS`: Size of the grid world (default is 10x10).
  - `TREASURE_POSITIONS`: Coordinates of treasures in the grid.
  - `WALLS`: List of horizontal and vertical walls defined by their start and end coordinates.
- **Agent Learning:**
  - `beta`: Learning rate for Q-learning (default is 0.6).
  - `alpha`: Discount factor for future rewards (default is 0.95).
- **Training Parameters (can be set by the user):**
  - `total_epochs`: Number of training epochs (default is 30).
  - `steps_per_epoch`: Number of steps per epoch (default is 30).
  - `max_moves_per_step`: Maximum moves allowed per step (default is 400).

## Code Structure

- **`main.py`:** The main script to run the grid world simulation.
- **Key Classes:**
  - `State`: Represents the agentâ€™s state, treasures, and termination condition.
  - `Agent`: Implements Q-learning with action selection, state updates, and reward calculation.
  - `GridWorldDisplay`: Handles the graphical rendering of the grid world using `pygame`.
- **Helper Functions:**
  - `generate_wall_segments`: Converts wall coordinates into renderable segments.
  - `is_valid_move`: Validates movement actions based on the grid and walls.
  - `random_start_position`: Generates a random initial position for the agent.

## Output

- A `pygame` window showing:
  - Agent position in blue.
  - Treasures in gold (green if collected).
  - Walls in black.
- A matplotlib plot of rewards per step across epochs and steps.
- Printed Q-Table showing the learned policy.
